# Dialect-Classification
This repository presents the data that was used in a talk at ICKL-5 (5th International Conference on Kurdish Linguistics)
at the University of Graz during September 24-24, 20201.
The title of the talk was "Can Linguistic Distance help Language Classification? Assessing Hawrami-Zaza and Kurmanji-Sorani".
The book of abstracts could be found at https://static.uni-graz.at/fileadmin/veranstaltungen/kurdishlinguistics2021/PDFs/ICKL-5_Book-of-Abstracts.pdf
For now, the Zazaki and Hawrami datasets are available. Datasets of Sorani and Kuramnji will be added later.
The datasets are Swadesh lists (207-entry) for the mentioned Kurdish dialects.
When using the data, please cite Kurdish-BLARK and this repository.
A paper is planned to be published in which case the corresponding citation will be mentioned here to be used in case of using the data.
More detail about the data and extra information will also be added later.
